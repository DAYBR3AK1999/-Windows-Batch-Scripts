# Windows-Batch-Scripts

Simple Backup System in a Windows batch script.

These scripts are useful if you want a scheduled task to dump and backup any chosen database by you or to backup any folder.

The output date of any zipped file / created directory using these scripts are in European format as Day-Month-Year.

For American date format as Month-Day-Year use the <a href="https://github.com/DAYBR3AK1999/Windows-Batch-Scripts/releases/tag/AmericanDateFormat">V1.0.1 Release</a></p>

More backup scripts coming soon.
